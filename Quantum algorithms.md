# ⚡ Quantum Algorithms (Deeper Dive)

🔹 1. Grover’s Algorithm (Search Faster)

Classical Search → Searching N items = O(N) steps.

Grover’s Search → Only O(√N) steps.


👉 Example:

Classical → Searching 1 item in 1,000,000 → 1M tries.

Quantum → Only ~1,000 tries!


📌 Used in: Database search, password cracking.

Python (Qiskit, very simplified):

from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
qc.h([0,1])  # Superposition
qc.cz(0,1)   # Oracle (mark solution)
qc.h([0,1])  # Amplify probability
qc.measure_all()
print(qc.draw())

🔹 2. Shor’s Algorithm (Breaking RSA)

Classical Factoring → Very slow for huge numbers.

Shor’s Algorithm → Factors numbers exponentially faster.


👉 Why scary?

All modern cryptography (RSA, ECC) depends on difficulty of factoring.

Quantum can break RSA → future requires Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC).


📌 Used in: Cybersecurity (or breaking it 😅).

🔹 3. Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)

Heart of many quantum algorithms (like Shor’s).

Helps in converting signals into frequency domain super fast.


📌 Used in: Signal processing, cryptography, optimization.


---

🔹 4. Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)

Many real-world problems = Optimization (finding best solution).

QAOA uses quantum + classical hybrid approach.


👉 Example:

Best stock portfolio selection.

Best route planning for delivery.


📌 Used in: Finance, logistics, operations research.

🔹 5. Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)

Solves energy states of molecules.

Very useful for chemistry & drug discovery.


📌 Used in: Pharma, material science.


---

🔹 6. Quantum Machine Learning (QML)

Use quantum to speed up AI training.

Quantum can represent & process data in higher dimensions.

Example: Quantum Neural Networks, Quantum SVMs.


📌 Used in: AI acceleration, pattern recognition.
